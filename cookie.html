    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>hese chocolaty cookie bars are somewhat of a cross between a brownie and a cookie, with a flavor reminiscent of Mexican hot chocolate. They're best if you err on the side of under- versus over-baking.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon instant espresso powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon strong brewed coffee

        </li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar

        </li>
        <li>¼ cup firmly packed brown sugar

        </li>
        <li>1 large egg, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract

        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Toppings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>! tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>
        Step 1
    </h3>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an 8x8-inch square pan with enough parchment paper to have overhang on all sides.</p>
    <h3>
        Step 2
    </h3>
    <p>Stir espresso powder and coffee together in a small bowl until espresso powder is completely dissolved.</p>
    <h3>
        Step 3
    </h3>
    <p>Whisk flour, cocoa, cream of tartar, baking soda, salt, and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon together in a bowl; set aside.</p>
    <h3>
        Step 4
    </h3>
    <p>Beat butter, 1/2 cup white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer together until light and fluffy in a bowl. Beat in espresso mixture, egg, and vanilla until well combined. Stir in flour mixture; mix until a dough just begins to form. Press dough firmly and evenly into the prepared pan using lightly floured hands.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Step 5
    </h3>
    <p>Whisk 1 tablespoon white sugar and remaining 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon together in a small bowl; sprinkle sugar mixture evenly over the dough.

    </p>
    <h3>
        Step 6
    </h3>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven just until the dough in the center of the pan feels barely set, 20 to 23 minutes.

    </p>
    <h3>
        Step 7
    </h3>
    <p>Allow cookies to cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Use the overhanging parchment to lift cookies out to a wire rack; cool completely before cutting into bars.
